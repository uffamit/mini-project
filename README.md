## Project Abstract

In today's digital environment, strong passwords are the first line of defense for securing personal information. This project presents a **Password Strength Checker**, a full-stack web application developed to address the common issue of weak password creation. The application is built with **Next.js** for the frontend, and a **Node.js** server with **Express.js** for the backend logic and API. **MongoDB** is used as the database to store user and analysis data. It provides users with real-time, pattern-based analysis of their passwords, offering visual feedback and actionable suggestions for improvement. Registered users can also securely track their analysis history, promoting better long-term password hygiene.

-----

## Features

  - ‚úÖ **Real-Time Strength Analysis:** The system evaluates password strength instantly as the user types.
  - üìä **Visual Feedback System:** An intuitive progress bar and a detailed checklist provide clear feedback on password criteria.
  - üîê **Secure User Authentication:** A custom-built authentication system handles secure user sign-up, login, and session management.
  - üóÇÔ∏è **Personalized Analysis History:** Authenticated users can view a history of their past password checks, which are securely stored in the database.
  - üì± **Responsive Design:** The user interface is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

  - **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
  - **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
  - **Database:** MongoDB
  - **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
